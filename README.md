# CEIE-Project
Study of road safety accident analysis with construction

This is a project I'm working on this year, and I'm currently studying 
the relationship between collisions and maintenance in the Virginia area.

Because of the flaws in this database, it cannot be presented in a clusting manner.
There is still a need for VDOT to be positioned for a given location to model

When I was looking at the Virginia area, I used waze to observe because of permission settings, 
and I used this website to measure:

https://trafficview.org/traffic_cameras/#12/38.9314/-77.2715

Currently in a data mining stage, in the future will be used to model a variety of algorithms

Raw_dataset:   raw dataset from VDOT, the original dataset
